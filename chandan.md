## Problem Statement

Build a reliable and robust backend system for the vehicle simulation algorithms

---
<!-- fg=green bg=black -->

# My approach

---
<!-- fg=green bg=black -->

## What technologies to use?
- Python, Django, Flask, MongoDB, Celery, Nginx

## How long do you have to build this?
- Less than three months

## What are the bare minimum requirements of the system?
- Four simulation algorithms
- Cater to atleast 50-100 concurrent users

# Challenges

---
<!-- fg=red bg=black -->

## 1. Learning a new framework in a short span of time

- Django
- Django Rest Framework
- Celery

---
<!-- fg=red bg=black -->

## 2. Design Choices

- Microservices
- Cloud Deployment: AWS(EC2, Cloudwatch)
- Security
	- Session token authorization for API
	- HTTPs based security mechanism for authentication
- Performance
- Scalability
	- Horizontal Scaling: More traffic => More Resources
	- Caching: Cache read only data to reduce latency, ORM based caching for application

---

## 3. Django

- Parsing deeply nested JSON data in Django(ORM)
```
@api_view(['POST'])
def my_view():
    ....
    my_data = 
    {
        'album_name': 'The Grey Album',
        'artist': 'Danger Mouse',
        'tracks': [
            {'order': 1, 'title': 'Public Service Announcement', 'duration': 245},
            {'order': 2, 'title': 'What More Can I Say', 'duration': 264},
            {'order': 3, 'title': 'Encore', 'duration': 159},
        ]
    }
    serializer = AlbumSerializer(data= my_data)
    serializer.is_valid()
    ....
```

## 3.1 Solution

```
class TrackSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Track
        fields = ['order', 'title', 'duration']

class AlbumSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    tracks = TrackSerializer(many=True)

    class Meta:
        model = Album
        fields = ['album_name', 'artist', 'tracks']

    def create(self, validated_data):
        tracks_data = validated_data.pop('tracks')
        album = Album.objects.create(**validated_data)
        for track_data in tracks_data:
            Track.objects.create(album=album, **track_data)
        return album
```
